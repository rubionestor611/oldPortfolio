                <p>I worked at GNC as a part-time sales associate. In my time there my main objectives were to run store operations, maintain housekeeping responsibilities,
                    and be able to coach customers towards the best supplemental solution for their personal fitness or wellness goals. All of this, being the only person
                    on shift given the nature of the position.

                <h4>May 2021 - Present</h4>
                <p>While attending the University of Central Florida in pursuit of my Bachelor's in Computer Science, I am a Perr Tutor for the SARC Department.
                    The main classes I tutor are those I focus on for my field. So far I have only tutored Computer Science I a class focused on teaching
                    Data Structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees, Min and Max Heaps and a few variances of each. Aside from the data structures,
                     it also teaches algorithms like Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and a few more. With these algorithms students learn about algorithm analysis and ways
                      to use the knowledge on these subjects to solve coding problems and their homework assignments.
