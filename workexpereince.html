                <h4>Oct. 2019 - Sep. 2021</h4>
                <p>I worked at GNC as a part-time sales associate. In my time there my main objectives were to run store operations, maintain housekeeping responsibilities,
                    and be able to coach customers towards the best supplemental solution for their personal fitness or wellness goals. All of this, being the only person
                    on shift given the nature of the position.

                <h2>UCF SARC Peer Tutor</h2>
                <h3>UCF SARC Tutoring Department</h3>
                <h4>May 2021 - Present</h4>
                <p>While attending the University of Central Florida in pursuit of my Bachelor's in Computer Science, I am a Peer Tutor for the SARC Department.
                    The classes I have tutored for are Computer Science I and Object-Oriented Programming.
                    CS1 is centered around data structures such as Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees, Heaps, and more.Aside from the data structures,
                     it also teaches algorithms like Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and a few more. With these algorithms students learn about algorithm analysis and ways
                    to use the knowledge on these subjects to solve coding problems and their homework assignments.
                    OOP is a class taught primarily in Java in which the 4 pillars of OOP like Encapuslation, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Inheritance are taught and applied throughout the semester. Later on the semesters devolve into other concepts which apply these ideas like GUIs or how they apply in an Agile work environment.

                <p>I'm glad I got to turn this project from FrontEndBootCamp into something more than what they gave us. With some curiosity and research I figured out how to turn a basic caluclator into something even cooler.</p>
