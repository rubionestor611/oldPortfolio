            <p>
                I'm a first-generation Salvadoran-American who has seen the great things a good work ethic and goal-setting can bring. One of my goals is to build up a good
                enough portfolio to eventually land an internship or even job position as a programmer. Of what sort or specialization? I have yet to decide but keep checking back here
                to see if that ever changes.
